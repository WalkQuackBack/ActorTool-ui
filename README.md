WIP, still need to work on a basic UI for this

sorry it's messy, threw it together in just a couple of days and there's already so much I want to refactor/change but I'm too lazy to

the files in `res/` were autogenerated and aren't vanilla files

if you're trying to use this, note that it does require my [fork of oead](https://github.com/dt-12345/oead) (though hopefully it'll be merged and up on pip soon)

to install the fork of oead, you will need cmake 3.12+ and a c++ compiler that supports c++17 (I used g++ from msys2)

then, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dt-12345/oead.git
cd oead
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install -e .
```
